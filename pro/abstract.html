<p><i>Consumers have grown suspect of what goes into their beverages and are demanding more transparency in its preparation. By all accounts, they have every right to be concerned!  Every year, 1 in 10 people in the world fall ill after consuming contaminated drinks. There have been highly publicized incidents where entire restaurant chains closed to address contamination and millions of grocery products were recalled due to environment group claiming the sodas contains high level of pesticides.
With block chain, accountability, traceability and quality assurance can be raised to such a level that companies can react to issues with the speed necessary to prevent additional people from getting sick. Investigations into food-borne illnesses that used to take weeks or months could be reduced to minutes if not seconds. This has the potential to give consumers an incredible amount of confidence, because they can know that everything in their beverages, and every place that the products touched, are fully accountable.
It’s my belief that as consumers become aware of block chain, learn of its benefits and hear real life success stories, they will want all the products they buy to be part of a block chain network
